# OSIC blog writing template

The following template is a guide on how to structure a blog post, following the
information provided in the [OSIC blog writing guide](https://github.com/osic/osic-docs/writing guides/osic-blog-writing.md).

## The opening paragraphs

The beginning of the blog post grabs your readers attention, and describes what
your post will cover.

**The first sentence**

Write the leading line of your post. It is often easier to write this opening
sentence after finishing the body of the post. This way, you have an idea of the
shape of your blog.

**The second sentence**

This is an important part of the blog - say clearly what the blog post will
discuss. For example, you could write:

* This post dicusses the advantages of one text editor over another.
* My bost describes the advantages of automated deployment tools.
* In this blog post, I specifically describe how to overcome the
challenges of writing new software.

**The third and fourth sentence**

In these sentences, you can start to describe why the blog post matters.
You can talk about the main idea of your post in more detail. You can also
introduce your expertise to speak on the blog subject in these sentences.

## The blog post body

**Bullet points can be useful here for listing sets of related information like
problems encountered:**

* Describe the background in more detail.
* Write about the historical context of the project.
* Describe the key problems involved with the project
* Follow up these problems descriptions with solutions.

Seprate out the body into short sections, and use headings to introduce solutions, or sentences that stand out.

**When describing problems or solutions you can add links to outside sources.**

Begin a paragraphs by introducing new information. Follow up that introduction with an evaluation of why the information is useful. Further sentences can provide examples of why the content is useful.

**Images added to the body of the blog can help to introduce, ellaborate on, or
provide an example of new information**.

## The conclusion

A short conclusion might say again why the provided information was helpful. Blog
conclusions usually includes a call to action. These invite the reader to seek out
more information. Using a final link at this stage can show readers where they can
read more information, or recieve help from Rackspace or the OSIC team.
