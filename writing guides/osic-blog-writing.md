## Blog writing suggestions

Before you start writing a blog post for an OSIC topic, consider
the following questions:

1. Is your post about to announce a new product or feature?
2. Will your post answer a question in the field, or offer help on
   finding a solution to a technical challenge?
3. For managers or subject matter experts, is your post providing
   *"thought leadership"* or showing expertise in your area?
4. For an event, is it to drive traffic to a landing page, or draw
   attendance to an event such as a webinar?
5. Is it something else altogether? If so, consider and define the blog post
   first.

**Always consider the goal of the post first.**

It is possible that your idea might be better presented as differnet
form of aritcle, as a presentation, or as a technical or marketing
white paper.

## General blog writing tips

Stay focused on your topic. If you find yourself straying, you may have
enough material for a series. It’s okay to break up a big topic into more
digestible bites.

Formulas like How to, Top 5 or 10, and curated lists tend to do well.

Consider who is your audience, and “be helpful” rather than trying to
sell a product or service. Consider how the OSIC development
helps the reader.

Use concrete examples whenever possible.

Bullet points are useful for listing features

Images can catch readers attention. Can you create a graphic or image, or add a
screen shot to illustrate your point?

Avoid jargon in your writing. Rackers (and the entire tech industry) tend to
speak in jargon. Unless your post is aimed at a technical audience, use
plain language. There is never a reason to use business jargon.

Link link link. First product mention? Link to the product page. Outside
accolades? Link to it. Citing a study or source or article? Link to it.
Has there been a similar OSIC blog post or article written about it before?
Link to it. Mention opensource software? Link to the site or documentation.

Keep it concise. attention span is, on average, short. Say it
once, and say it well. No need to repeat the same information in different
format. Similarly, keep paragraphs short. Long blocks of text
are intimidating.

## Blog Writing Format

The following formatting points are worthwhile to consider when structuring
your blog post:

**Length**: Rackspace blog posts generally run between 500-1,000 words, but
let the content be your guide. Take the space you need to tell your story, but
don’t pad it unnecessarily. Going long is okay, too, as long as it’s
worth reading.

**Tools**: A word processor, like M.S. Word, or a text editor for your writing.

**Opening Sentence**: An attention-grabbing opening, known as a “lede”.

**Second and third sentences**: A “nut graf” - a sentence or two letting readers
know what you’re going to be talking about and why it matters.

**Blog body content**: Introduce some background information or context, such
as the history of a product.

**A short conclusion**: Include a a call to action, if appropriate, with links
and contact information.
